Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/suite-landing-page-tj_eaU-Ra" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- A little bit of flexbox for some positioning

# What I learned
- Figured out how to do gradients with specific positions for when the color changes
- Learned that having a container and then giving its contents 100% width will make them scale with the screen size as the parent itself increases in size

# Looking Back
- This one was much more complex than any of the projects I've done so far! I'm realizing I need to practice visualising how to set up my grid more before actually getting to work - The main thing I struggle with is telling when/where I'll need a container with a grid, within the main grid.
- I'm not sure if the way I did the white and cream background was the best solution - I ended up going with a gradient that switches to the cream color at a specific % of the page, and it stretches to any width and height to cover both axes from there.
- I'm not sure if there were more elegant solutions to the positioning of the glow behind the guy and the arc above the "Solution" word in the header at the top? The rest of the project was fairly straightforward. Working with grid areas made it very convenient to shuffle things around for the tablet and mobile layouts.
- I'm wondering if there was a better way to get the font variables for the tablet and mobile layouts. I could've probably used calc() with the original variable instead of declaring new ones. Not sure which one is best practice?

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
